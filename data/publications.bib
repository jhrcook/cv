  abstract  = "Mutational activation of KRAS promotes the initiation and
               progression of cancers, especially in the colorectum, pancreas,
               lung, and blood plasma, with varying prevalence of specific
               activating missense mutations. Although epidemiological studies
               connect specific alleles to clinical outcomes, the mechanisms
               underlying the distinct clinical characteristics of mutant KRAS
               alleles are unclear. Here, we analyze 13,492 samples from these
               four tumor types to examine allele- and tissue-specific genetic
               properties associated with oncogenic KRAS mutations. The
               prevalence of known mutagenic mechanisms partially explains the
               observed spectrum of KRAS activating mutations. However, there
               are substantial differences between the observed and predicted
               frequencies for many alleles, suggesting that biological
               selection underlies the tissue-specific frequencies of mutant
               alleles. Consistent with experimental studies that have
               identified distinct signaling properties associated with each
               mutant form of KRAS, our genetic analysis reveals that each KRAS
               allele is associated with a distinct tissue-specific comutation
               network. Moreover, we identify tissue-specific genetic
               dependencies associated with specific mutant KRAS alleles.
               Overall, this analysis demonstrates that the genetic
               interactions of oncogenic KRAS mutations are allele- and
               tissue-specific, underscoring the complexity that drives their
               clinical consequences. The KRAS gene is often mutated at several
               hotspot codons in cancer, resulting in similar, yet distinct,
               functional impacts on the KRAS protein. Here, the authors
               examine the genetic interactions of the different KRAS mutations
               across multiple cancer types and discover that KRAS mutations
               have allele- and tissue-specific mutagenic origins, comutation
               patterns, and dependency interactions.",

  abstract = "KRAS is the most frequently mutated oncogene. The incidence of
              specific KRAS alleles varies between cancers from different
              sites, but it is unclear whether allelic selection results from
              biological selection for specific mutant KRAS proteins. We used a
              cross-disciplinary approach to compare KRASG12D, a common mutant
              form, and KRASA146T, a mutant that occurs only in selected
              cancers. Biochemical and structural studies demonstrated that
              KRASA146T exhibits a marked extension of switch 1 away from the
              protein body and nucleotide binding site, which activates KRAS by
              promoting a high rate of intrinsic and guanine nucleotide
              exchange factor-induced nucleotide exchange. Using mice
              genetically engineered to express either allele, we found that
              KRASG12D and KRASA146T exhibit distinct tissue-specific effects
              on homeostasis that mirror mutational frequencies in human
              cancers. These tissue-specific phenotypes result from
              allele-specific signaling properties, demonstrating that
              context-dependent variations in signaling downstream of different
              KRAS mutants drive the KRAS mutational pattern seen in cancer.
              SIGNIFICANCE: Although epidemiologic and clinical studies have
              suggested allele-specific behaviors for KRAS, experimental
              evidence for allele-specific biological properties is limited. We
              combined structural biology, mass spectrometry, and mouse
              modeling to demonstrate that the selection for specific KRAS
              mutants in human cancers from different tissues is due to their
              distinct signaling properties.See related commentary by Hobbs and

              of cell-surface integrins, which translate extracellular signals
              into cytoskeletal changes to mediate adhesion and migration.
              Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular parasite that infects
              migratory cells and enhances their motility, but the mechanisms
              underlying T. gondii-induced hypermotility are incompletely
              understood. We investigated the molecular basis for the
              hypermotility of primary human peripheral blood monocytes and
              THP-1 cells infected with T. gondii Compared with uninfected
              monocytes, T. gondii infection of monocytes reduced cell
              spreading and the number of activated $\beta$1 integrin clusters
              in contact with fibronectin during settling, an effect not
              observed in monocytes treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or
              Escherichia coli Furthermore, T. gondii infection disrupted the
              phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) at tyrosine 397
              (Tyr-397) and Tyr-925 and of the related protein proline-rich
              tyrosine kinase (Pyk2) at Tyr-402. The localization of paxillin,
              FAK, and vinculin to focal adhesions and the colocalization of
              these proteins with activated $\beta$1 integrins were also
              impaired in T. gondii-infected monocytes. Using time-lapse
              confocal microscopy of THP-1 cells expressing enhanced GFP
              (eGFP)-FAK during settling on fibronectin, we found that T.
              gondii-induced monocyte hypermotility was characterized by a
              reduced number of enhanced GFP-FAK-containing clusters over time
              compared with uninfected cells. This study demonstrates an
              integrin conformation-independent regulation of the $\beta$1
              integrin adhesion pathway, providing further insight into the
              molecular mechanism of T. gondii-induced monocyte hypermotility.",

  abstract = "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder characterized
              by a variety of physiological and behavioral dysregulations,
              including hyperphagia, a condition that can lead to
              life-threatening obesity. Feeding behavior is a highly complex
              process with multiple feedback loops that involve both peripheral
              and central systems. The arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus
              (ARH) is critical for the regulation of homeostatic processes
              including feeding, and this nucleus develops during neonatal life
              under of the influence of both environmental and genetic factors.
              Although much attention has focused on the metabolic and
              behavioral outcomes of PWS, an understanding of its effects on
              the development of hypothalamic circuits remains elusive. Here,
              we show that mice lacking Magel2, one of the genes responsible
              for the etiology of PWS, display an abnormal development of ARH
              axonal projections. Notably, the density of anorexigenic
              $\alpha$-melanocyte-stimulating hormone axons was reduced in
              adult Magel2-null mice, while the density of orexigenic
              agouti-related peptide fibers in the mutant mice appeared
              identical to that in control mice. On the basis of previous
              findings showing a pivotal role for metabolic hormones in
              hypothalamic development, we also measured leptin and ghrelin
              levels in Magel2-null and control neonates and found that mutant
              mice have normal leptin and ghrelin levels. In vitro experiments
              show that Magel2 directly promotes axon growth. Together, these
              findings suggest that a loss of Magel2 leads to the disruption of
              hypothalamic feeding circuits, an effect that appears to be
              independent of the neurodevelopmental effects of leptin and
              ghrelin and likely involves a direct neurotrophic effect of
              Magel2.",
