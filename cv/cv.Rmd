Teaching Experience {data-icon=chalkboard-teacher}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Private Tutoring

N/A

Cambridge, MA

September 2018 - June 2021

I tutored a high school student every evening.
In any one night, our topics would range from history to physics to computer science.
Mainly, I ensured that he understood the material and helped him grasp topics he found difficult.
While I had a good handle on most of the information covered, sometimes his course material stretched well beyond my comfort level (for example, his Mandarin courses).
When I found myself in these scenarios, I probed his understanding by asking questions and having him teach me the material.

### Teaching Assistant

### Tutor

UCI Learning and Academic Resource Center

Irvine, CA

August 2015 - September 2016

I led group tutoring sessions for undergraduate students as part of the Learning and Academic Resource Center (LARC) at UCI. I have tutored an Introductory Biology course, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Calculus.


Leadership and Mentoring {data-icon=walking}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Irvine Little League Manager

Little League Baseball

Irvine, CA

February 2016 - June 2016, January 2017 - July 2017

My first year, I co-managed a Majors division (11 - 12 year olds) baseball team in the Irvine Ranch Little League and co-managed the 11 year-oldâ€™s All Star Team over the summer. My second season, I managed my own team in the AA division (8-10 year olds). I fulfilled several administrative roles including attending league meetings, organizing parent volunteers, and scheduling practices and games. My goal as a manager of these young boys was to emulate maturity, determination, and level-headedness, especially when under pressure. Excitingly, my AA team was season champion and won the Irvine City Championship Tournament!

### Tutor Advisor

UCI Learning and Academic Resource Center

Irvine, CA

March 2016 - June 2017

I instructed LARC tutors in improving their tutorials and teaching methods. In addition, I spent a lot of time interacting with the tutors to make sure they were managing their course load and job in an efficient and healthy manner. I had an administrative role, as well. In particular, I orchestrated the scheduling and creation of LARC tutorials and handled day-to-day problems that inevitably arose.


### Peer Mentor

UCI Campuswide Honors Program

Irvine, CA

August 2016 - June 2017

I assisted four incoming freshmen in acclimating to UC Irvine. I supported them by alerting them to useful resources, answering questions they have about classes, and helping them work through a stressful period in their academic career.

### Peer Scholars Mentor

Scholarship and Opportunities Program (SOP)

Irvine, CA

September 2016 - January 2017

I helped three UCI Barry Goldwater Scholarship applicants prepare their applications. Though the applicants had research experience and strong academic standing, they are inexperienced in drafting national scholarship applications. As I had won the Goldwater Scholarship and applied for the Churchill Scholarship and Fulbright Fellowship, my goal was to guide these students through the process and assist them in crafting a strong application.


Honors and Awards {data-icon=award}

```{r honors-awards, message=FALSE}
print_honors_and_awards <- function(honors_awards_df) {

    table_to_section()
}

read_tsv(HONORS_AND_AWARDS_FILE) %>%
  print_honors_and_awards()
```
